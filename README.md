1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure TOR:**
   - Download and extract the TOR Expert Bundle.
   - Edit your `torrc` file to include:
     ```

tor_launcher.py â€” Minimal TOR Bootstrapper
This script launches the TOR service using a custom tor.exe binary and configuration file (torrc). 
Designed for automation workflows, scraping shields, or privacy-first routing setups.

ðŸ”§ Requirements
Windows system with TOR installed

Valid paths to:

tor.exe binary

torrc configuration file

5. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
